Branching Strategy:

`main` - This branch contains the combined code from other branches. Please note that direct code pushes are not permitted; instead, contributors must create a pull request _with at least one approved review_.

When creating a new branch, adhere to the following convention: use `<your_name>_feature/<feature_name or user_story_number>` for feature branches or `<your_name>_bugfix/<feature_name or user_story_number>` if it is a bugfix branch.


> _Remember to always take a pull from the `main` branch before you start working on any feature or bug_
