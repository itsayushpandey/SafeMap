I'm announcing today that the NYPD will overhaul its marijuana enforcement policies in the next 30 days. We must end unnecessary arrests and end disparity in enforcement. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez also asserted his stance on marijuana cases Tuesday by highlighting a pilot program launched three months ago by his office. As a part of the pilot program, the Brooklyn DA\\u2019s office, according to Gonzalez, has already been declining to prosecute \\u201csome instances of smoking marijuana in public where a public nuisance was not created.\\u201d \\u201cI believe that low-level marijuana cases should be responded to with summonses rather than arrests,\\u201d Gonzalez said. \\u201cSince 2014, the Brooklyn DA\\u2019s Office has led the way in declining to prosecute marijuana possession cases, resulting in a 75 percent decline in arrests citywide and confirming that such policy does not adversely affect public safety.\\u201d Statement by Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez Regarding Handling of Marijuana Arrests: pic.twitter.com/u6a3rkqPDH Tuesday\\u2019s announcements suggest that New York \\u2015\\u00a0a state currently exploring the possibility of legalizing marijuana altogether, as other states have \\u2015\\u00a0is starting to more forcefully tackle the disproportionate rates at which black people get arrested for marijuana, even though black and white people use marijuana at almost the same rates, according to the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. A New York Times analysis published Sunday revealed that in New York City, black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate of white people over the past three years. The rates were even worse in Manhattan, where black people were arrested on marijuana charges at 15 times the rate of white people. The Manhattan DA\\u2019s office findings echoed the Times\\u2019 research.\\u00a0 Noting the racial disparity of marijuana arrests, the Manhattan DA\\u2019s office said Tuesday\\u00a0that \\u201clarge numbers of New Yorkers become further alienated from law enforcement and removed from community participation at an enormous cost to the criminal justice system, for virtually no punitive, rehabilitative or deterrent purpose.\\u201d\",\n          \"\\u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\\u201d the culmination of a 10-year Marvel film journey,\\u00a0set the record for both domestic and global opening grosses at the box office this weekend, according to Box Office Mojo.

Still, the international grosses for the opening are even more astounding because the film shattered the record without Russia or China, where it opens May 3 and May 11, respectively.

This pleases Thanos.\",\n          \" It's hard to discuss the genre often referred to as \\\"outsider art\\\" without calling into question the term itself. Referencing art made not only on the periphery of the artistic institution, but on the outskirts of society and culture in the widest sense, the category generates a boundary in its very utterance, erecting a spoken wall between what's in and what's out. A recently closed group exhibition at David Zwirner Gallery in New York City, titled \\\"System and Vision,\\\" featured artists \\\"whose unique ideas developed outside the circuit of art world institutions,\\\" in the words of the gallery.  The show featured the work of 11 artists and one anonymous collective, some creating erotic drawings, others rigidly formulaic photographs; some lifelike dolls, others convoluted calendars. What ties the exhibition and its wide range of artists together, is their mutual distance from market trends and art historical traditions -- including any awareness or expectation of being a publicly viewed artist whatsoever.\\r\\n Chris Hipkiss, Forget The Sun, 2012, Mixed media on paper, 57 1/2 x 36 1/4 inches (146 x 92 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Despite the fact that the artists on view might never have anticipated they'd be shown at a gallery, here they were, suddenly featured at one of the biggest and most powerful contemporary art spaces in the world. As ArtReview put it, the haven is \\\"the closest a commercial gallery can come to being a museum.\\\" Last year David Zwirner himself came in at No. 2 in the publication's yearly roundup of the art world's \\\"Power 100,\\\" ranking above fellow art dealer Larry Gagosian, MoMA director Glenn Lowry and Jeff Koons, among many, many others. All of which is to say, the gallery is most definitely not an \\\"outsider\\\" gallery. So where does that put \\\"System and Vision,\\\" a medley of artists suddenly placed on the same walls as art world giants like Yayoi Kusama, Richard Serra and Dan Flavin? Let's take a closer look at the substance of the show, which was organized -- into four thematic categories: eroticism, pseudo-science, science fiction and the occult -- in collaboration with Delmes & Zander, a gallery based in Germany that focuses on \\\"conceptual outsider art.\\\"\\r\\n William Crawford, Untitled, 1990s, Pencil on paper, 11 x 8 1/2 inches (28 x 21.5 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Sex is a common subject for many artists, but the erotic terrain navigated by visionaries operates somewhat differently. This particular breed of \\\"raw erotica\\\" is a mode of intense desire that is rarely translated into physical copulation -- whether due to geographical isolation, physical or developmental disability. Such carnal impulses reach their fruition in the act of art-making itself, yielding visuals that stray from the depictions of sex we widely encounter in art, film, porn and real life. Some are naive, others aggressive or just plain bizarre, depending on the artist's exposure to sex in the flesh as opposed to on the page. One such erotically inclined artist is William Crawford, a man whose name is only known by his signature, sprawled on some of the hundreds of orgiastic drawings discovered in an abandoned house in Oakland, California. Many of the works were created on the backs of prison rosters in the 1990s, leading to the theory that Crawford created them behind bars, yearning for sexual activity. The frequent appearance of a man with an afro and mustache, thought to be Crawford himself, provides a potential visual reference for the artist. The pencil on paper drawings depict leather-clad bombshells, group sexual encounters, rape scenes and other taboo reveries, in a style that shifts from exaggerated and cartoonish to startlingly precise. Amersand Gallery describes Crawford's artistic style as \\\"more a dream than documentation, more fantasy than perversion: the mise en sc\\u00e8ne of a sexual reverie in which Crawford is king.\\\"\\r\\n Morton Bartlett, Untitled, ca. 1950, Vintage gelatin silver print, 4 x 5 1/8 inches (10 x 13 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  An even stranger take on the erotic theme manifests itself in the work of Morton Bartlett, a graphic designer who, at the age of 27, furtively began crafting incredibly lifelike dolls of boys and girls ranging in age from eight to sixteen. Between 1936 and 1960 Bartlett created 15 dolls in secret, meticulously carving and painting their bodies as well as creating their ensembles from scratch.  The dolls look as sinister as the unusual hobby sounds. \\\"They project childish innocence,\\\" Ken Johnson wrote for the Boston Globe, \\\"but in Bartlett's hands innocence becomes a kind of tease. Note the glimpses of underwear and lacy petticoats in many of the photographs. Looking at these dolls is like seeing through the eyes of a pedophile.\\\"  Although there's some level of desire pulsing through Bartlett's dolls, there is nothing explicitly aligning them with sex. In \\\"How to Look at Outsider Art,\\\" Lyle Rexer aligns the artist's mission with that of Edgar Degas, bringing his bronze ballerinas to life. For Rexer, Bartlett's standout feat is using the power of the camera to bring the lifeless dolls a sense of uncanny vitality. \\\"They take their place almost seamlessly among the vast archive of the once-but-no-longer-alive captured in photographs, and in death they gain a convincing vitality they do not have as objects.\\\"\\r\\n Type 42 (Anonymous), Star Trek, 1960s-1970s, Mixed media on Polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Also exploring the mystifying abilities of photography is the found collection of 950 Polaroids referred to as Type 42, capturing the expressions of television, B-movie and sci-fi actresses. The dizzying black-and-white photos, taken between 1969 and 1972, capture starlet's faces like floating heads against a black backdrop, pixelated, buckled and sparkling. Details are scribbled on the borders of the images, fastidiously recording each actress' name, television program or movie title, and sometimes measurements.  \\\"The survey of the archive shows that the photographer went to great lengths to capture specific poses and moments within these televised shows and movies. The viewer can only guess the number of 'takes' that must have cycled through to get each final shot.\\\" David Zwirner Gallery notes the level of obsession not only applied to the actresses themselves, but to the archiving system of the project itself. An artist known as Prophet Royal Robertson, who was born in 1936 and later developed paranoid schizophrenia, bridges the categories of erotica and sci-fi with his violent and apocalyptic cardboard depictions. His piece \\\"THE DAY THE WORLD END\\\" (many of his drawings are titled in all-caps) seems to stem from his first vision at 14 years old, of a space ship with God as a driver. Memories of his ex-wife\\u2019s unfaithfulness later started to fuse with his with schizophrenic hallucinations, until the impending threat of global female conspiracy seemed inevitable. His works combine futuristic prophecies with violent, misogynist fantasies, all pointing back to his own sense of powerlessness.\\r\\n Prophet Royal Robertson, THE DAY THE WORLD END, 1990s, Ink, marker, and enamel on cardboard, 28 x 22 1/8 inches (71 x 56 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Often, the term \\\"outsider art\\\" tells more about the artist -- and his or her life story, mental or emotional aptitude -- than the art. It's a genre normally dictated by a certain kind of story more than a singular style. However, David Zwirner Gallery's statement never once uses the term \\\"outsider art.\\\" Possibly, in part, because after showing at Zwirner, they're not quite outsiders anymore. As the show's title conveys, the artists of \\\"System and Vision\\\" overlap with their individualized, yet mutually obsessive practices, as well as their imaginative visions, each molding an entire world inside the mind. Rather than highlighting the stories of the artists on view, the organizers emphasize the primary inklings of a thematic foundation, a potential method that could unite an anonymous batch of fame-crazy Polaroids from the '60s with a bizarre trove of erotic pencil drawings from the '90s. The emphasis shifts from the story to the style.  It would be incorrect to say that because these artists showed at Zwirner they are now a part of the same league as the gallery's world famous darlings. That's, in part, why 11 of them showed at once. However, for many of the exhibited artists, some of whom remain anonymous or nearly entirely cloaked in mystery, it's a radical step toward the mainstream, perhaps an unthinkable one.  As the phrase \\\"outsider art\\\" creates a discriminatory boundary, divesting untrained artists from their rightful places in the artistic spotlight, \\\"System and Vision\\\" could be a step forward. As could the language of its press release, which refuses to use the term \\\"outsider art\\\" nor another alternative. It's unusual to see a name like William Crawford alongside Alice Neel, even if its sandwiched among 10 other names. Hopefully one day it won't be.\\r\\n Type 42 (Anonymous), Carroll Baker, 1960s-1970s, Mixed media on Polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n Harald Bender, Untitled, 1999-2014 (detail), Mixed media on paper in plastic files in file folder, file folder: 11 1/2 x 12 5/8 x 3 1/8 inches (29 x 32 x 8 cm), 200 pages, each: 11 7/8 x 8 1/4 inches (30 x 21 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n Miroslav Tich\\u00fd, Untitled, n.d., Mixed media on paper on cardboard, 9 1/2 x 10 1/8 inches (24 x 25.5 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n Prophet Royal Robertson, NO GOOD PROUD BASTARDS, 1995, Ink, marker, and paint on cardboard, 28 x 22 1/8 inches (71 x 56 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n William Crawford, Untitled, 1990s, Pencil on paper, 11 x 8 1/2 inches (28 x 21.5 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne) \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

As a part of the pilot program, the Brooklyn DA\\u2019s office, according to Gonzalez, has already been declining to prosecute \\u201csome instances of smoking marijuana in public where a public nuisance was not created.\\u201d \\u201cI believe that low-level marijuana cases should be responded to with summonses rather than arrests,\\u201d Gonzalez said. \\u201cSince 2014, the Brooklyn DA\\u2019s Office has led the way in declining to prosecute marijuana possession cases, resulting in a 75 percent decline in arrests citywide and confirming that such policy does not adversely affect public safety.\\u201d Statement by Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez Regarding Handling of Marijuana Arrests: pic.twitter.com/u6a3rkqPDH Tuesday\\u2019s announcements suggest that New York \\u2015\\u00a0a state currently exploring the possibility of legalizing marijuana altogether, as other states have \\u2015\\u00a0is starting to more forcefully tackle the disproportionate rates at which black people get arrested for marijuana, even though black and white people use marijuana at almost the same rates, according to the 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. A New York Times analysis published Sunday revealed that in New York City, black people were arrested on low-level marijuana charges at eight times the rate of white people over the past three years. The rates were even worse in Manhattan, where black people were arrested on marijuana charges at 15 times the rate of white people. The Manhattan DA\\u2019s office findings echoed the Times\\u2019 research.\\u00a0 Noting the racial disparity of marijuana arrests, the Manhattan DA\\u2019s office said Tuesday\\u00a0that \\u201clarge numbers of New Yorkers become further alienated from law enforcement and removed from community participation at an enormous cost to the criminal justice system, for virtually no punitive, rehabilitative or deterrent purpose.\\u201d\",\n          \"\\u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\\u201d the culmination of a 10-year Marvel film journey,\\u00a0set the record for both domestic and global opening grosses at the box office this weekend, according to Box Office Mojo.

This pleases Thanos.\",\n          \" It's hard to discuss the genre often referred to as \\\"outsider art\\\" without calling into question the term itself. Referencing art made not only on the periphery of the artistic institution, but on the outskirts of society and culture in the widest sense, the category generates a boundary in its very utterance, erecting a spoken wall between what's in and what's out. A recently closed group exhibition at David Zwirner Gallery in New York City, titled \\\"System and Vision,\\\" featured artists \\\"whose unique ideas developed outside the circuit of art world institutions,\\\" in the words of the gallery.  The show featured the work of 11 artists and one anonymous collective, some creating erotic drawings, others rigidly formulaic photographs; some lifelike dolls, others convoluted calendars. What ties the exhibition and its wide range of artists together, is their mutual distance from market trends and art historical traditions -- including any awareness or expectation of being a publicly viewed artist whatsoever.\\r\\n Chris Hipkiss, Forget The Sun, 2012, Mixed media on paper, 57 1/2 x 36 1/4 inches (146 x 92 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Despite the fact that the artists on view might never have anticipated they'd be shown at a gallery, here they were, suddenly featured at one of the biggest and most powerful contemporary art spaces in the world. As ArtReview put it, the haven is \\\"the closest a commercial gallery can come to being a museum.\\\" Last year David Zwirner himself came in at No. 2 in the publication's yearly roundup of the art world's \\\"Power 100,\\\" ranking above fellow art dealer Larry Gagosian, MoMA director Glenn Lowry and Jeff Koons, among many, many others. All of which is to say, the gallery is most definitely not an \\\"outsider\\\" gallery. So where does that put \\\"System and Vision,\\\" a medley of artists suddenly placed on the same walls as art world giants like Yayoi Kusama, Richard Serra and Dan Flavin? Let's take a closer look at the substance of the show, which was organized -- into four thematic categories: eroticism, pseudo-science, science fiction and the occult -- in collaboration with Delmes & Zander, a gallery based in Germany that focuses on \\\"conceptual outsider art.\\\"\\r\\n William Crawford, Untitled, 1990s, Pencil on paper, 11 x 8 1/2 inches (28 x 21.5 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Sex is a common subject for many artists, but the erotic terrain navigated by visionaries operates somewhat differently. This particular breed of \\\"raw erotica\\\" is a mode of intense desire that is rarely translated into physical copulation -- whether due to geographical isolation, physical or developmental disability. Such carnal impulses reach their fruition in the act of art-making itself, yielding visuals that stray from the depictions of sex we widely encounter in art, film, porn and real life. Some are naive, others aggressive or just plain bizarre, depending on the artist's exposure to sex in the flesh as opposed to on the page. One such erotically inclined artist is William Crawford, a man whose name is only known by his signature, sprawled on some of the hundreds of orgiastic drawings discovered in an abandoned house in Oakland, California. Many of the works were created on the backs of prison rosters in the 1990s, leading to the theory that Crawford created them behind bars, yearning for sexual activity. The frequent appearance of a man with an afro and mustache, thought to be Crawford himself, provides a potential visual reference for the artist. The pencil on paper drawings depict leather-clad bombshells, group sexual encounters, rape scenes and other taboo reveries, in a style that shifts from exaggerated and cartoonish to startlingly precise. Amersand Gallery describes Crawford's artistic style as \\\"more a dream than documentation, more fantasy than perversion: the mise en sc\\u00e8ne of a sexual reverie in which Crawford is king.\\\"\\r\\n Morton Bartlett, Untitled, ca. 1950, Vintage gelatin silver print, 4 x 5 1/8 inches (10 x 13 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  An even stranger take on the erotic theme manifests itself in the work of Morton Bartlett, a graphic designer who, at the age of 27, furtively began crafting incredibly lifelike dolls of boys and girls ranging in age from eight to sixteen. Between 1936 and 1960 Bartlett created 15 dolls in secret, meticulously carving and painting their bodies as well as creating their ensembles from scratch.  The dolls look as sinister as the unusual hobby sounds. \\\"They project childish innocence,\\\" Ken Johnson wrote for the Boston Globe, \\\"but in Bartlett's hands innocence becomes a kind of tease. Note the glimpses of underwear and lacy petticoats in many of the photographs. Looking at these dolls is like seeing through the eyes of a pedophile.\\\"  Although there's some level of desire pulsing through Bartlett's dolls, there is nothing explicitly aligning them with sex. In \\\"How to Look at Outsider Art,\\\" Lyle Rexer aligns the artist's mission with that of Edgar Degas, bringing his bronze ballerinas to life. For Rexer, Bartlett's standout feat is using the power of the camera to bring the lifeless dolls a sense of uncanny vitality. \\\"They take their place almost seamlessly among the vast archive of the once-but-no-longer-alive captured in photographs, and in death they gain a convincing vitality they do not have as objects.\\\"\\r\\n Type 42 (Anonymous), Star Trek, 1960s-1970s, Mixed media on Polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Also exploring the mystifying abilities of photography is the found collection of 950 Polaroids referred to as Type 42, capturing the expressions of television, B-movie and sci-fi actresses. The dizzying black-and-white photos, taken between 1969 and 1972, capture starlet's faces like floating heads against a black backdrop, pixelated, buckled and sparkling. Details are scribbled on the borders of the images, fastidiously recording each actress' name, television program or movie title, and sometimes measurements.  \\\"The survey of the archive shows that the photographer went to great lengths to capture specific poses and moments within these televised shows and movies. The viewer can only guess the number of 'takes' that must have cycled through to get each final shot.\\\" David Zwirner Gallery notes the level of obsession not only applied to the actresses themselves, but to the archiving system of the project itself. An artist known as Prophet Royal Robertson, who was born in 1936 and later developed paranoid schizophrenia, bridges the categories of erotica and sci-fi with his violent and apocalyptic cardboard depictions. His piece \\\"THE DAY THE WORLD END\\\" (many of his drawings are titled in all-caps) seems to stem from his first vision at 14 years old, of a space ship with God as a driver. Memories of his ex-wife\\u2019s unfaithfulness later started to fuse with his with schizophrenic hallucinations, until the impending threat of global female conspiracy seemed inevitable. His works combine futuristic prophecies with violent, misogynist fantasies, all pointing back to his own sense of powerlessness.\\r\\n Prophet Royal Robertson, THE DAY THE WORLD END, 1990s, Ink, marker, and enamel on cardboard, 28 x 22 1/8 inches (71 x 56 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)  Often, the term \\\"outsider art\\\" tells more about the artist -- and his or her life story, mental or emotional aptitude -- than the art. It's a genre normally dictated by a certain kind of story more than a singular style. However, David Zwirner Gallery's statement never once uses the term \\\"outsider art.\\\" Possibly, in part, because after showing at Zwirner, they're not quite outsiders anymore. As the show's title conveys, the artists of \\\"System and Vision\\\" overlap with their individualized, yet mutually obsessive practices, as well as their imaginative visions, each molding an entire world inside the mind. Rather than highlighting the stories of the artists on view, the organizers emphasize the primary inklings of a thematic foundation, a potential method that could unite an anonymous batch of fame-crazy Polaroids from the '60s with a bizarre trove of erotic pencil drawings from the '90s. The emphasis shifts from the story to the style.  It would be incorrect to say that because these artists showed at Zwirner they are now a part of the same league as the gallery's world famous darlings. That's, in part, why 11 of them showed at once. However, for many of the exhibited artists, some of whom remain anonymous or nearly entirely cloaked in mystery, it's a radical step toward the mainstream, perhaps an unthinkable one.  As the phrase \\\"outsider art\\\" creates a discriminatory boundary, divesting untrained artists from their rightful places in the artistic spotlight, \\\"System and Vision\\\" could be a step forward. As could the language of its press release, which refuses to use the term \\\"outsider art\\\" nor another alternative. It's unusual to see a name like William Crawford alongside Alice Neel, even if its sandwiched among 10 other names. Hopefully one day it won't be.\\r\\n Type 42 (Anonymous), Carroll Baker, 1960s-1970s, Mixed media on Polaroid, 3 1/4 x 4 1/4 inches (8.3 x 10.8 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n Harald Bender, Untitled, 1999-2014 (detail), Mixed media on paper in plastic files in file folder, file folder: 11 1/2 x 12 5/8 x 3 1/8 inches (29 x 32 x 8 cm), 200 pages, each: 11 7/8 x 8 1/4 inches (30 x 21 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n Miroslav Tich\\u00fd, Untitled, n.d., Mixed media on paper on cardboard, 9 1/2 x 10 1/8 inches (24 x 25.5 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n Prophet Royal Robertson, NO GOOD PROUD BASTARDS, 1995, Ink, marker, and paint on cardboard, 28 x 22 1/8 inches (71 x 56 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne)\\r\\n William Crawford, Untitled, 1990s, Pencil on paper, 11 x 8 1/2 inches (28 x 21.5 cm), Courtesy Galerie Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander (Berlin + Cologne) \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_crime\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Whether you're ironing your slacks, packing up your checkbook, or boarding the Ferry to Randall's Island with hopes of getting your butt tickled by a sexy octopus, we got you covered. Behold, the 10 most buzzy, striking, dizzying and just plain bizarre happenings on this year's bill.  If you're looking to test your physical strength, eat an ice-cream cone or perhaps make a quick $20, read on to make your artistic dreams a reality.  1. Pia Camil's Free Ponchos\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17 (although we fear the ponchos are already long gone)\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Charlie Porter (@thecharlieporter) on May 13, 2015 at 1:38pm PDT Mexican artist Pia Camil is giving away 800 wearable artworks -- also known as ponchos -- on a first come, first serve basis in the Projects section of Frieze New York.  \\\"Camil's textiles require direct participation, quietly emphasizing the characteristic experience of the art fair, where the act of looking at art is as important as the act of looking at others and distinguishing oneself from them,\\\" the wall label reads. The stunning status symbols, made from fabric remnants and leftovers, are certainly the most stylish works at the fair, not to mention the cheapest. 2. Rebecca Goyette's Dentata Umbrella Lounge\\r\\nWhen: May 14\\u201317\\r\\nWhere: Select Fair, Center 548, Manhattan A post shared by Rebecca Goyette (@rebeccajgoyette) on May 13, 2015 at 4:11pm PDT A post shared by Rebecca Morgan (@rebeccamorgan10) on May 13, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT Performance artist Rebecca Goyette is bringing all the weirdness to Select Art Fair. Her Octopussy-inspired installation \\\"Dentata Umbrella Lounge\\\" includes, among other things, a vibrating Lobsta Labia pillow.   3. Jonathan Horowitz at Gavin Brown's Enterprise\\r\\nWhen: May 14 - 17\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Paul Laster (@plasternyc) on May 14, 2015 at 10:56am PDT A post shared by Paul Laster (@plasternyc) on May 14, 2015 at 10:13am PDT Want to make a quick $20 this art fair weekend? Artist Jonathan Horowitz is inviting fair-goers to participate in his interactive installation at Gavin Brown's booth at Frieze New York. Participants are asked to add acrylic paint onto eight-inch-diameter circles on square-foot canvases, which are then mounted into seven 50-by-50 clusters. Those who succeed walk away with a $20 check -- or an original Jonathan Horowitz, depending on how you look at it. \\\"The whole project, in this iteration, particularity, is about blurring lines,\\\" Horowitz told Vulture. \\\"A lot of work goes into making art beyond the person whose name is signed to the canvas. Art incorporates the installers, the dealers, the people who guard the work, the people who buy the work, the people who write about the work\\u2026 This is about the hand striving for perfection and its inevitable failure to achieve it.\\\" 4. 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair\\r\\nWhen: May 15\\u201317\\r\\nWhere: Pioneer Works, Brooklyn  Billie Zangewa The new Brooklyn fair everyone is talking about, the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair, is hosting 15 galleries either based in Africa or focusing in African contemporary art, located everywhere from Marrakech to Seattle, as well as programming from artists like Hank Willis Thomas. We're particularly excited for Sunday's book launch of \\\"Body Talk: Feminism, Sexuality and the Body in the Work of Six African Women Artists,\\\" featuring curator Koyo Kouoh and participating artist Marcia Kure.

The highly anticipated happening consists of a 200-foot-long, one-way labyrinth, full of physical and psychological artist-designed challenges sure to make your head spin and body wobble. Some portions are direct replicas of the '70s original, others are contemporary interpretations of the theme. Artists Amalia Pica, John Bock, and Gelatin are responsible for the new segments.  \\\"Upside down forests, balloon pits, and pianos that control portals,\\\" ArtNews reported on the madness. \\\"The maze is full of puzzles and physical challenges. Doorknobs are rarely what they seem... Tip-toeing on tilting catwalks and plunging bare feet into pools of beans, it was hard not to go through the whole delightful thing grinning. At least until the last rooms, designed by John Bock. A tangle of wires and medical tubes hung from the ceiling in the penultimate stretch. A small monitor embedded in the snarl showed a bearded man who seemed to be sleeping. Menacing, but manageable. Pushing past that, Bock served up one final challenge: squeezing through a tunnel lined by large, mostly naked hirsute men, a birth canal of bears.\\\" \\\"Art is meant to stretch you,\\\" Deborah Fisher said of the installation. \\\"And there\\u2019s not a lot else in the fair that\\u2019s doing that.\\\" 10. Samara Golden's Secret Underground Layer\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17, 2015\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan  Samara Golden. Bad Brains, Frieze Fair NY, 2012 Installation shot. Los Angeles artist Samara Golden brings a sinister underbelly to Frieze New York, building a tripped-out infinity chamber beneath the fair tent. Golden's hall of mirrors, which ArtSlant aptly described as \\\"M.C. Escher meets Miami Vice,\\\" features life-sized, hand-sewn, stuffed figures, a couch and chair made from fabrics ranging from bacon strips to flowers to snakes, with a dash of Christian worship stuff and Native American-style bead patterns. There are also skeletons painted in transparent phosphorescent paint, which the viewer can see in the form of a reflection. \\\"Originally I just wanted to show the other side of the fair,\\\" Golden told Phaidon, \\\"or for my piece to be in opposition to the capitalist psychology of the fair. I\\u2019ve been thinking a lot about visualizing layers of consciousness in terms of space.\\\" BONUS: \\u2018Aesthetics\\u2019 of \\u2018Female\\u2019 \\u2018Attractiveness\\u2019\\r\\nWhen: May 15, 12 p.m.\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Karley Sciortino (@karleyslutever) on May 14, 2015 at 3:14pm PDT As part of Frieze Talks 2015, join your artsy girl crushes Jane Ellison, Grace Dunham, Reina Gossett, Karley Sciortino and Leilah Weinraub as they discuss (rather irreverently) the aesthetics of female attractiveness, with lots of air quotes in there.\",\n          \"Scientists in Scotland may have discovered the most effective way to blast bacteria from health care workers' hands. They say a\\u00a0thorough six-step technique\\u00a0using an alcohol-based hand rub,\\u00a0as recommended by the World Health Organization, is the best method. Watch how it's done: Jacqui Reilly, a professor of infection prevention and control at Glasgow Caledonian University, led a study observing how 42 doctors and 72 nurses used the rub and cleaned their hands after treating patients. For the research, which was\\u00a0published\\u00a0this month in\\u00a0Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, scientists recorded how long it took the health care\\u00a0workers to wash their hands, as well as their pre- and post-washing median bacterial counts.\\u00a0 The health care workers who performed the six-step technique took an average of 42.5 seconds and reduced their median bacterial count from 3.28 to 2.58. Those who used a three-step technique --\\u00a0applying the alcohol-based product to one hand, rubbing their hands together until they were fully covered, then rubbing until they were dry\\u00a0--\\u00a0spent 7.5 seconds less on the process. Their median bacterial count lowered from 3.08 to an average of 2.88. Reilly said that there had previously been \\\"limited evidence on which technique is most effective\\\" and that this study provided \\\"a foundation for effective best practices to implement on the front lines of healthcare.\\\"\",\n          \"The younger sister of Dylann Roof, the convicted mass murderer who\\u00a0killed nine people\\u00a0at a historic black church in South Carolina, was arrested Wednesday for allegedly bringing weapons to her school on the same day the National Student Walkout was planned. Morgan Roof, an 18-year-old student of A.C. Flora High School in Columbia, South Carolina, was charged with possession of marijuana and two counts of carrying weapons on school grounds, according to The State newspaper. An administrator at the school alerted a school resource officer that a student on campus had made a threatening and racist Snapchat post and brought pepper spray and a knife to school. The Richland County Sheriff\\u2019s Department later confirmed that the student was Morgan Roof. Roof\\u2019s Snapchat post criticized her schoolmates at Flora High for participating in the nationwide student walkouts in protest of gun violence on Wednesday. The protests were being held on the one-month anniversary of a horrific mass shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \\u201cI hope it\\u2019s a trap and y\\u2019all get shot,\\u201d Roof wrote of the protest at her school, according to a screenshot of her Snapchat post. \\u201cWe know it\\u2019s fixing to be nothing but black people walkin out anyway. This is Morgan Roof, Dylann Roofs little sister, her snapchats there and all do your thang twitter pic.twitter.com/MttSF875is Roof\\u2019s racist post was especially disturbing considering the heinous crimes of her brother, who is an avowed white supremacist. In June 2015, Dylann Roof walked into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston and opened fire on a Bible study group. He killed nine people. The 22-year-old shooter was found guilty on 33 federal charges and sentenced to death. One of Dylann Roof\\u2019s friends told investigators that he hoped the massacre would start a race war. In a letter to students, parents and faculty,\\u00a0Principal Susan Childs said that a student\\u2019s social media post caused \\u201cquite a disruption\\u201d on campus. Childs\\u2019 letter did not identify Morgan Roof but described her post as a \\u201chateful message\\u201d that was \\u201cextremely inappropriate.\\u201d Chris Slick, a neighbor of the Roofs, told The Post and Courier that Morgan Roof wasn\\u2019t hateful. \\u201cTragedy has struck this family again,\\u201d Slick told the newspaper.\\u00a0 \\u201cThis is not the Morgan I knew. She didn\\u2019t hate people. She didn\\u2019t have prejudices like this \\u2014 in fact, I witnessed the opposite,\\u201d\\u00a0he added. \\u201cI hope that one day, one day she finds peace and seeks forgiveness for what she did today. I cannot say I wish the same for her brother.\\u201d In a series of tweets, Gov. Henry McMaster said that \\u201cpotential tragedy was avoided\\u201d at Flora High on Wednesday. He also called on the state General Assembly to pass legislation requiring police officers to be present\\u00a0at every school.\\u00a0\\u00a0 Law enforcement officials took Morgan Roof to the Richland County Detention Center, according to CBS affiliate WLTX 19. She was released on a $5,000 bond with the condition that she not return to school.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_crime\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Whether you're ironing your slacks, packing up your checkbook, or boarding the Ferry to Randall's Island with hopes of getting your butt tickled by a sexy octopus, we got you covered. Behold, the 10 most buzzy, striking, dizzying and just plain bizarre happenings on this year's bill.  If you're looking to test your physical strength, eat an ice-cream cone or perhaps make a quick $20, read on to make your artistic dreams a reality.  1. Pia Camil's Free Ponchos\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17 (although we fear the ponchos are already long gone)\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Charlie Porter (@thecharlieporter) on May 13, 2015 at 1:38pm PDT Mexican artist Pia Camil is giving away 800 wearable artworks -- also known as ponchos -- on a first come, first serve basis in the Projects section of Frieze New York.  \\\"Camil's textiles require direct participation, quietly emphasizing the characteristic experience of the art fair, where the act of looking at art is as important as the act of looking at others and distinguishing oneself from them,\\\" the wall label reads. The stunning status symbols, made from fabric remnants and leftovers, are certainly the most stylish works at the fair, not to mention the cheapest. 2. Rebecca Goyette's Dentata Umbrella Lounge\\r\\nWhen: May 14\\u201317\\r\\nWhere: Select Fair, Center 548, Manhattan A post shared by Rebecca Goyette (@rebeccajgoyette) on May 13, 2015 at 4:11pm PDT A post shared by Rebecca Morgan (@rebeccamorgan10) on May 13, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT Performance artist Rebecca Goyette is bringing all the weirdness to Select Art Fair. Her Octopussy-inspired installation \\\"Dentata Umbrella Lounge\\\" includes, among other things, a vibrating Lobsta Labia pillow.   3. Jonathan Horowitz at Gavin Brown's Enterprise\\r\\nWhen: May 14 - 17\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Paul Laster (@plasternyc) on May 14, 2015 at 10:56am PDT A post shared by Paul Laster (@plasternyc) on May 14, 2015 at 10:13am PDT Want to make a quick $20 this art fair weekend? Artist Jonathan Horowitz is inviting fair-goers to participate in his interactive installation at Gavin Brown's booth at Frieze New York. Participants are asked to add acrylic paint onto eight-inch-diameter circles on square-foot canvases, which are then mounted into seven 50-by-50 clusters. Those who succeed walk away with a $20 check -- or an original Jonathan Horowitz, depending on how you look at it. \\\"The whole project, in this iteration, particularity, is about blurring lines,\\\" Horowitz told Vulture. \\\"A lot of work goes into making art beyond the person whose name is signed to the canvas. Art incorporates the installers, the dealers, the people who guard the work, the people who buy the work, the people who write about the work\\u2026 This is about the hand striving for perfection and its inevitable failure to achieve it.\\\" 4. 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair\\r\\nWhen: May 15\\u201317\\r\\nWhere: Pioneer Works, Brooklyn  Billie Zangewa The new Brooklyn fair everyone is talking about, the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair, is hosting 15 galleries either based in Africa or focusing in African contemporary art, located everywhere from Marrakech to Seattle, as well as programming from artists like Hank Willis Thomas. We're particularly excited for Sunday's book launch of \\\"Body Talk: Feminism, Sexuality and the Body in the Work of Six African Women Artists,\\\" featuring curator Koyo Kouoh and participating artist Marcia Kure. See a preview of the fair on Artsy. 5. Blinded by the Light\\r\\nWhen: May 14\\u201317\\r\\nWhere: Select Fair, Center 548, Manhattan The Marina Abromovi\\u0107 Institute presents @Millie_Brown \\\"Blinded by the Light\\\" @SelectFair #SELECT #Art #MillieBrown pic.twitter.com/6TY717bHpl Performance artist Millie Brown, formerly known as our personal favorite vomit artist, is changing direction a bit with her Marina Abramovic Institute (MAI) collar \\\"Blinded by the Light.\\\" At Select Fair, over the course of four days -- or four sun cycles -- Brown will wait in a room of light and looping sound as grains of sand fall onto her head and body until she's eventually buried in a pyramid of the stuff. According to her statement, \\\"she aims to transcend into a state of pure light.\\\" Ambitious indeed. 6. Flux Art Fair\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17\\r\\nWhere: The Corn Exchange Building, Manhattan A post shared by kHyal\\u2122 is MegaGlam\\u2122. (@khyal) on May 13, 2015 at 6:09pm PDT This marks the inaugural edition of Flux, Harlem's first contemporary art fair, a curator-led display revolving around the theme of \\\"21st Century Artist As a Nomad.\\\" The fair also hosts Harlem EatUp!, a wildly delicious looking festival combining all the cultural sights and flavors of Harlem,  organized by Red Rooster's Marcus Samuelsson and Herb Kalitz. \\\"I wanted to marry the best chefs in the country with the best talent in Harlem,\\\" Samuelsson told The New York Post. Our mouths are watering just thinking about it.  7. Spencer Finch's Solar-Powered Ice Cream Truck\\r\\nWhen: May 15-20\\r\\nWhere: Central Park's North End, Manhattan Free ice cream?? #SpencerFinch's \\u201cSunset (Central Park)\\u201d opens @CentralParkNYC this Friday! http://t.co/mh03ira3mG pic.twitter.com/cL3j1XBO37 #Solar powered #icecream! #DriftingInDaylight #Spencerfinch @creativetimeNYC pic.twitter.com/28a8iu8giR As part of Creative Time and Central Park Conservancy's Drifting in Daylight, artist Spencer Finch is bringing an artwork sure to please eco-friendly art lovers and randomly wandering five-year-olds alike. Because ice cream! The artist's rainbow sherbet-colored, solar-powered ice cream truck will dole out soft serve cones that capture all the various hues of spring. 8. Ragnar Kjartansson's \\\"S.S. Hangover\\\"\\r\\nWhen: May 15-20\\r\\nWhere: Central Park's North End, Manhattan Here's #RagnarKjartansson and his musicians (from @metroensemble) taking the S.S. Hangover\\u2026 http://t.co/cuuquInbxS pic.twitter.com/DjS1RdREoS Also a part of Drifting in Daylight, Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson is providing a cure for that champagne-induced headache of yours, in the form of a fishing boat, an ethereal hybrid of Greek, Icelandic and Venetian design. Dubbed \\\"S.S. Hangover,\\\" the part-sculpture, part-sound piece, part-performance, part-vehicle comes complete with a a sextet of brass-playing musicians.  \\u201cI really love music, I have always been in bands, but I think the constraints of the music industry are stifling,\\u201d Kjartansson explained regarding the piece. \\u201cI can do so much more with music by working with sound as a form of sculpture, using sound to take you on a journey.\\\" 9. \\\"Tribute to Flux-Labyrinth 1976/2015\\\"\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by SoftSpot (@softspot.io) on May 14, 2015 at 3:02pm PDT Posted by George Maciunas / Fluxus Foundation Inc. on Monday, April 6, 2015\\r\\n One installation at Frieze New York will pay tribute to the Flux-Labyrinth, an immersive, maze-like environment originally conceived by George Maciunas in collaboration with other Fluxus artists between 1975 and 1976. The highly anticipated happening consists of a 200-foot-long, one-way labyrinth, full of physical and psychological artist-designed challenges sure to make your head spin and body wobble. Some portions are direct replicas of the '70s original, others are contemporary interpretations of the theme. Artists Amalia Pica, John Bock, and Gelatin are responsible for the new segments.  \\\"Upside down forests, balloon pits, and pianos that control portals,\\\" ArtNews reported on the madness. \\\"The maze is full of puzzles and physical challenges. Doorknobs are rarely what they seem... Tip-toeing on tilting catwalks and plunging bare feet into pools of beans, it was hard not to go through the whole delightful thing grinning. At least until the last rooms, designed by John Bock. A tangle of wires and medical tubes hung from the ceiling in the penultimate stretch. A small monitor embedded in the snarl showed a bearded man who seemed to be sleeping. Menacing, but manageable. Pushing past that, Bock served up one final challenge: squeezing through a tunnel lined by large, mostly naked hirsute men, a birth canal of bears.\\\" \\\"Art is meant to stretch you,\\\" Deborah Fisher said of the installation. \\\"And there\\u2019s not a lot else in the fair that\\u2019s doing that.\\\" 10. Samara Golden's Secret Underground Layer\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17, 2015\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan  Samara Golden. Bad Brains, Frieze Fair NY, 2012 Installation shot. Los Angeles artist Samara Golden brings a sinister underbelly to Frieze New York, building a tripped-out infinity chamber beneath the fair tent. Golden's hall of mirrors, which ArtSlant aptly described as \\\"M.C. Escher meets Miami Vice,\\\" features life-sized, hand-sewn, stuffed figures, a couch and chair made from fabrics ranging from bacon strips to flowers to snakes, with a dash of Christian worship stuff and Native American-style bead patterns. There are also skeletons painted in transparent phosphorescent paint, which the viewer can see in the form of a reflection. \\\"Originally I just wanted to show the other side of the fair,\\\" Golden told Phaidon, \\\"or for my piece to be in opposition to the capitalist psychology of the fair. I\\u2019ve been thinking a lot about visualizing layers of consciousness in terms of space.\\\" BONUS: \\u2018Aesthetics\\u2019 of \\u2018Female\\u2019 \\u2018Attractiveness\\u2019\\r\\nWhen: May 15, 12 p.m.\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Karley Sciortino (@karleyslutever) on May 14, 2015 at 3:14pm PDT As part of Frieze Talks 2015, join your artsy girl crushes Jane Ellison, Grace Dunham, Reina Gossett, Karley Sciortino and Leilah Weinraub as they discuss (rather irreverently) the aesthetics of female attractiveness, with lots of air quotes in there.\",\n          \"Scientists in Scotland may have discovered the most effective way to blast bacteria from health care workers' hands. They say a\\u00a0thorough six-step technique\\u00a0using an alcohol-based hand rub,\\u00a0as recommended by the World Health Organization, is the best method. Watch how it's done: Jacqui Reilly, a professor of infection prevention and control at Glasgow Caledonian University, led a study observing how 42 doctors and 72 nurses used the rub and cleaned their hands after treating patients. For the research, which was\\u00a0published\\u00a0this month in\\u00a0Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, scientists recorded how long it took the health care\\u00a0workers to wash their hands, as well as their pre- and post-washing median bacterial counts.\\u00a0 The health care workers who performed the six-step technique took an average of 42.5 seconds and reduced their median bacterial count from 3.28 to 2.58. Those who used a three-step technique --\\u00a0applying the alcohol-based product to one hand, rubbing their hands together until they were fully covered, then rubbing until they were dry\\u00a0--\\u00a0spent 7.5 seconds less on the process. Their median bacterial count lowered from 3.08 to an average of 2.88. Reilly said that there had previously been \\\"limited evidence on which technique is most effective\\\" and that this study provided \\\"a foundation for effective best practices to implement on the front lines of healthcare.\\\"\",\n          \"The younger sister of Dylann Roof, the convicted mass murderer who\\u00a0killed nine people\\u00a0at a historic black church in South Carolina, was arrested Wednesday for allegedly bringing weapons to her school on the same day the National Student Walkout was planned. Morgan Roof, an 18-year-old student of A.C. Flora High School in Columbia, South Carolina, was charged with possession of marijuana and two counts of carrying weapons on school grounds, according to The State newspaper. An administrator at the school alerted a school resource officer that a student on campus had made a threatening and racist Snapchat post and brought pepper spray and a knife to school. The Richland County Sheriff\\u2019s Department later confirmed that the student was Morgan Roof. Roof\\u2019s Snapchat post criticized her schoolmates at Flora High for participating in the nationwide student walkouts in protest of gun violence on Wednesday. The protests were being held on the one-month anniversary of a horrific mass shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \\u201cI hope it\\u2019s a trap and y\\u2019all get shot,\\u201d Roof wrote of the protest at her school, according to a screenshot of her Snapchat post. \\u201cWe know it\\u2019s fixing to be nothing but black people walkin out anyway. This is Morgan Roof, Dylann Roofs little sister, her snapchats there and all do your thang twitter pic.twitter.com/MttSF875is Roof\\u2019s racist post was especially disturbing considering the heinous crimes of her brother, who is an avowed white supremacist. In June 2015, Dylann Roof walked into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston and opened fire on a Bible study group. He killed nine people. The 22-year-old shooter was found guilty on 33 federal charges and sentenced to death. One of Dylann Roof\\u2019s friends told investigators that he hoped the massacre would start a race war. In a letter to students, parents and faculty,\\u00a0Principal Susan Childs said that a student\\u2019s social media post caused \\u201cquite a disruption\\u201d on campus. Childs\\u2019 letter did not identify Morgan Roof but described her post as a \\u201chateful message\\u201d that was \\u201cextremely inappropriate.\\u201d Chris Slick, a neighbor of the Roofs, told The Post and Courier that Morgan Roof wasn\\u2019t hateful. \\u201cTragedy has struck this family again,\\u201d Slick told the newspaper.\\u00a0 \\u201cThis is not the Morgan I knew. She didn\\u2019t hate people. She didn\\u2019t have prejudices like this \\u2014 in fact, I witnessed the opposite,\\u201d\\u00a0he added. \\u201cI hope that one day, one day she finds peace and seeks forgiveness for what she did today. I cannot say I wish the same for her brother.\\u201d In a series of tweets, Gov. Henry McMaster said that \\u201cpotential tragedy was avoided\\u201d at Flora High on Wednesday. He also called on the state General Assembly to pass legislation requiring police officers to be present\\u00a0at every school.\\u00a0\\u00a0 Law enforcement officials took Morgan Roof to the Richland County Detention Center, according to CBS affiliate WLTX 19. She was released on a $5,000 bond with the condition that she not return to school.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_crime\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 599,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"crazybeautiful things happening art world weekend\",\n          \"hospice overdosed patients hasten deaths former health care executive admits\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Whether you're ironing your slacks, packing up your checkbook, or boarding the Ferry to Randall's Island with hopes of getting your butt tickled by a sexy octopus, we got you covered. Behold, the 10 most buzzy, striking, dizzying and just plain bizarre happenings on this year's bill.  If you're looking to test your physical strength, eat an ice-cream cone or perhaps make a quick $20, read on to make your artistic dreams a reality.  1. Pia Camil's Free Ponchos\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17 (although we fear the ponchos are already long gone)\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Charlie Porter (@thecharlieporter) on May 13, 2015 at 1:38pm PDT Mexican artist Pia Camil is giving away 800 wearable artworks -- also known as ponchos -- on a first come, first serve basis in the Projects section of Frieze New York.  \\\"Camil's textiles require direct participation, quietly emphasizing the characteristic experience of the art fair, where the act of looking at art is as important as the act of looking at others and distinguishing oneself from them,\\\" the wall label reads. The stunning status symbols, made from fabric remnants and leftovers, are certainly the most stylish works at the fair, not to mention the cheapest. 2. Rebecca Goyette's Dentata Umbrella Lounge\\r\\nWhen: May 14\\u201317\\r\\nWhere: Select Fair, Center 548, Manhattan A post shared by Rebecca Goyette (@rebeccajgoyette) on May 13, 2015 at 4:11pm PDT A post shared by Rebecca Morgan (@rebeccamorgan10) on May 13, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT Performance artist Rebecca Goyette is bringing all the weirdness to Select Art Fair. Her Octopussy-inspired installation \\\"Dentata Umbrella Lounge\\\" includes, among other things, a vibrating Lobsta Labia pillow.   3. Jonathan Horowitz at Gavin Brown's Enterprise\\r\\nWhen: May 14 - 17\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Paul Laster (@plasternyc) on May 14, 2015 at 10:56am PDT A post shared by Paul Laster (@plasternyc) on May 14, 2015 at 10:13am PDT Want to make a quick $20 this art fair weekend? Artist Jonathan Horowitz is inviting fair-goers to participate in his interactive installation at Gavin Brown's booth at Frieze New York. Participants are asked to add acrylic paint onto eight-inch-diameter circles on square-foot canvases, which are then mounted into seven 50-by-50 clusters. Those who succeed walk away with a $20 check -- or an original Jonathan Horowitz, depending on how you look at it. \\\"The whole project, in this iteration, particularity, is about blurring lines,\\\" Horowitz told Vulture. \\\"A lot of work goes into making art beyond the person whose name is signed to the canvas. Art incorporates the installers, the dealers, the people who guard the work, the people who buy the work, the people who write about the work\\u2026 This is about the hand striving for perfection and its inevitable failure to achieve it.\\\" 4. 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair\\r\\nWhen: May 15\\u201317\\r\\nWhere: Pioneer Works, Brooklyn  Billie Zangewa The new Brooklyn fair everyone is talking about, the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair, is hosting 15 galleries either based in Africa or focusing in African contemporary art, located everywhere from Marrakech to Seattle, as well as programming from artists like Hank Willis Thomas. We're particularly excited for Sunday's book launch of \\\"Body Talk: Feminism, Sexuality and the Body in the Work of Six African Women Artists,\\\" featuring curator Koyo Kouoh and participating artist Marcia Kure. See a preview of the fair on Artsy. 5. Blinded by the Light\\r\\nWhen: May 14\\u201317\\r\\nWhere: Select Fair, Center 548, Manhattan The Marina Abromovi\\u0107 Institute presents @Millie_Brown \\\"Blinded by the Light\\\" @SelectFair #SELECT #Art #MillieBrown pic.twitter.com/6TY717bHpl Performance artist Millie Brown, formerly known as our personal favorite vomit artist, is changing direction a bit with her Marina Abramovic Institute (MAI) collar \\\"Blinded by the Light.\\\" At Select Fair, over the course of four days -- or four sun cycles -- Brown will wait in a room of light and looping sound as grains of sand fall onto her head and body until she's eventually buried in a pyramid of the stuff. According to her statement, \\\"she aims to transcend into a state of pure light.\\\" Ambitious indeed. 6. Flux Art Fair\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17\\r\\nWhere: The Corn Exchange Building, Manhattan A post shared by kHyal\\u2122 is MegaGlam\\u2122. (@khyal) on May 13, 2015 at 6:09pm PDT This marks the inaugural edition of Flux, Harlem's first contemporary art fair, a curator-led display revolving around the theme of \\\"21st Century Artist As a Nomad.\\\" The fair also hosts Harlem EatUp!, a wildly delicious looking festival combining all the cultural sights and flavors of Harlem,  organized by Red Rooster's Marcus Samuelsson and Herb Kalitz. \\\"I wanted to marry the best chefs in the country with the best talent in Harlem,\\\" Samuelsson told The New York Post. Our mouths are watering just thinking about it.  7. Spencer Finch's Solar-Powered Ice Cream Truck\\r\\nWhen: May 15-20\\r\\nWhere: Central Park's North End, Manhattan Free ice cream?? #SpencerFinch's \\u201cSunset (Central Park)\\u201d opens @CentralParkNYC this Friday! http://t.co/mh03ira3mG pic.twitter.com/cL3j1XBO37 #Solar powered #icecream! #DriftingInDaylight #Spencerfinch @creativetimeNYC pic.twitter.com/28a8iu8giR As part of Creative Time and Central Park Conservancy's Drifting in Daylight, artist Spencer Finch is bringing an artwork sure to please eco-friendly art lovers and randomly wandering five-year-olds alike. Because ice cream! The artist's rainbow sherbet-colored, solar-powered ice cream truck will dole out soft serve cones that capture all the various hues of spring. 8. Ragnar Kjartansson's \\\"S.S. Hangover\\\"\\r\\nWhen: May 15-20\\r\\nWhere: Central Park's North End, Manhattan Here's #RagnarKjartansson and his musicians (from @metroensemble) taking the S.S. Hangover\\u2026 http://t.co/cuuquInbxS pic.twitter.com/DjS1RdREoS Also a part of Drifting in Daylight, Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson is providing a cure for that champagne-induced headache of yours, in the form of a fishing boat, an ethereal hybrid of Greek, Icelandic and Venetian design. Dubbed \\\"S.S. Hangover,\\\" the part-sculpture, part-sound piece, part-performance, part-vehicle comes complete with a a sextet of brass-playing musicians.  \\u201cI really love music, I have always been in bands, but I think the constraints of the music industry are stifling,\\u201d Kjartansson explained regarding the piece. \\u201cI can do so much more with music by working with sound as a form of sculpture, using sound to take you on a journey.\\\" 9. \\\"Tribute to Flux-Labyrinth 1976/2015\\\"\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by SoftSpot (@softspot.io) on May 14, 2015 at 3:02pm PDT Posted by George Maciunas / Fluxus Foundation Inc. on Monday, April 6, 2015\\r\\n One installation at Frieze New York will pay tribute to the Flux-Labyrinth, an immersive, maze-like environment originally conceived by George Maciunas in collaboration with other Fluxus artists between 1975 and 1976. The highly anticipated happening consists of a 200-foot-long, one-way labyrinth, full of physical and psychological artist-designed challenges sure to make your head spin and body wobble. Some portions are direct replicas of the '70s original, others are contemporary interpretations of the theme. Artists Amalia Pica, John Bock, and Gelatin are responsible for the new segments.  \\\"Upside down forests, balloon pits, and pianos that control portals,\\\" ArtNews reported on the madness. \\\"The maze is full of puzzles and physical challenges. Doorknobs are rarely what they seem... Tip-toeing on tilting catwalks and plunging bare feet into pools of beans, it was hard not to go through the whole delightful thing grinning. At least until the last rooms, designed by John Bock. A tangle of wires and medical tubes hung from the ceiling in the penultimate stretch. A small monitor embedded in the snarl showed a bearded man who seemed to be sleeping. Menacing, but manageable. Pushing past that, Bock served up one final challenge: squeezing through a tunnel lined by large, mostly naked hirsute men, a birth canal of bears.\\\" \\\"Art is meant to stretch you,\\\" Deborah Fisher said of the installation. \\\"And there\\u2019s not a lot else in the fair that\\u2019s doing that.\\\" 10. Samara Golden's Secret Underground Layer\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17, 2015\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan  Samara Golden. Bad Brains, Frieze Fair NY, 2012 Installation shot. Los Angeles artist Samara Golden brings a sinister underbelly to Frieze New York, building a tripped-out infinity chamber beneath the fair tent. Golden's hall of mirrors, which ArtSlant aptly described as \\\"M.C. Escher meets Miami Vice,\\\" features life-sized, hand-sewn, stuffed figures, a couch and chair made from fabrics ranging from bacon strips to flowers to snakes, with a dash of Christian worship stuff and Native American-style bead patterns. There are also skeletons painted in transparent phosphorescent paint, which the viewer can see in the form of a reflection. \\\"Originally I just wanted to show the other side of the fair,\\\" Golden told Phaidon, \\\"or for my piece to be in opposition to the capitalist psychology of the fair. I\\u2019ve been thinking a lot about visualizing layers of consciousness in terms of space.\\\" BONUS: \\u2018Aesthetics\\u2019 of \\u2018Female\\u2019 \\u2018Attractiveness\\u2019\\r\\nWhen: May 15, 12 p.m.\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Karley Sciortino (@karleyslutever) on May 14, 2015 at 3:14pm PDT As part of Frieze Talks 2015, join your artsy girl crushes Jane Ellison, Grace Dunham, Reina Gossett, Karley Sciortino and Leilah Weinraub as they discuss (rather irreverently) the aesthetics of female attractiveness, with lots of air quotes in there.\",\n          \"Scientists in Scotland may have discovered the most effective way to blast bacteria from health care workers' hands. They say a\\u00a0thorough six-step technique\\u00a0using an alcohol-based hand rub,\\u00a0as recommended by the World Health Organization, is the best method. Watch how it's done: Jacqui Reilly, a professor of infection prevention and control at Glasgow Caledonian University, led a study observing how 42 doctors and 72 nurses used the rub and cleaned their hands after treating patients. For the research, which was\\u00a0published\\u00a0this month in\\u00a0Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, scientists recorded how long it took the health care\\u00a0workers to wash their hands, as well as their pre- and post-washing median bacterial counts.\\u00a0 The health care workers who performed the six-step technique took an average of 42.5 seconds and reduced their median bacterial count from 3.28 to 2.58. Those who used a three-step technique --\\u00a0applying the alcohol-based product to one hand, rubbing their hands together until they were fully covered, then rubbing until they were dry\\u00a0--\\u00a0spent 7.5 seconds less on the process. Their median bacterial count lowered from 3.08 to an average of 2.88. Reilly said that there had previously been \\\"limited evidence on which technique is most effective\\\" and that this study provided \\\"a foundation for effective best practices to implement on the front lines of healthcare.\\\"\",\n          \"The younger sister of Dylann Roof, the convicted mass murderer who\\u00a0killed nine people\\u00a0at a historic black church in South Carolina, was arrested Wednesday for allegedly bringing weapons to her school on the same day the National Student Walkout was planned. Morgan Roof, an 18-year-old student of A.C. Flora High School in Columbia, South Carolina, was charged with possession of marijuana and two counts of carrying weapons on school grounds, according to The State newspaper. An administrator at the school alerted a school resource officer that a student on campus had made a threatening and racist Snapchat post and brought pepper spray and a knife to school. The Richland County Sheriff\\u2019s Department later confirmed that the student was Morgan Roof. Roof\\u2019s Snapchat post criticized her schoolmates at Flora High for participating in the nationwide student walkouts in protest of gun violence on Wednesday. The protests were being held on the one-month anniversary of a horrific mass shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \\u201cI hope it\\u2019s a trap and y\\u2019all get shot,\\u201d Roof wrote of the protest at her school, according to a screenshot of her Snapchat post. \\u201cWe know it\\u2019s fixing to be nothing but black people walkin out anyway. This is Morgan Roof, Dylann Roofs little sister, her snapchats there and all do your thang twitter pic.twitter.com/MttSF875is Roof\\u2019s racist post was especially disturbing considering the heinous crimes of her brother, who is an avowed white supremacist. In June 2015, Dylann Roof walked into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston and opened fire on a Bible study group. He killed nine people. The 22-year-old shooter was found guilty on 33 federal charges and sentenced to death. One of Dylann Roof\\u2019s friends told investigators that he hoped the massacre would start a race war. In a letter to students, parents and faculty,\\u00a0Principal Susan Childs said that a student\\u2019s social media post caused \\u201cquite a disruption\\u201d on campus. Childs\\u2019 letter did not identify Morgan Roof but described her post as a \\u201chateful message\\u201d that was \\u201cextremely inappropriate.\\u201d Chris Slick, a neighbor of the Roofs, told The Post and Courier that Morgan Roof wasn\\u2019t hateful. \\u201cTragedy has struck this family again,\\u201d Slick told the newspaper.\\u00a0 \\u201cThis is not the Morgan I knew. She didn\\u2019t hate people. She didn\\u2019t have prejudices like this \\u2014 in fact, I witnessed the opposite,\\u201d\\u00a0he added. \\u201cI hope that one day, one day she finds peace and seeks forgiveness for what she did today. I cannot say I wish the same for her brother.\\u201d In a series of tweets, Gov. Henry McMaster said that \\u201cpotential tragedy was avoided\\u201d at Flora High on Wednesday. He also called on the state General Assembly to pass legislation requiring police officers to be present\\u00a0at every school.\\u00a0\\u00a0 Law enforcement officials took Morgan Roof to the Richland County Detention Center, according to CBS affiliate WLTX 19. She was released on a $5,000 bond with the condition that she not return to school.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

        "title = \"Trump poses unique challenges for jury in his hush-money trial\"\n",
        "body = \"\"\" Three months ago, Donald Trump took the stand before a jury of nine in a New York courtroom without his typical bombast or ranting. The former president’s complaints about the case and his sparring with the judge took place out of the jury’s sight in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, and he gave quick, scripted testimony lasting about three minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following day, however, Trump found a way to protest the trial with the jury’s eyes on him, storming out during the closing argument delivered by Carroll’s lawyer. “The record will reflect that Mr. Trump just rose and walked out of the courtroom,” Judge Lewis Kaplan announced, in case any jurors had missed it.\n",
        "\n",
        "That same afternoon, the jury returned an $83.3 million verdict against Trump for defaming Carroll — a massive figure that the columnist’s attorneys attribute in part to Trump’s protest.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think it hurt him terribly,” Carroll attorney Roberta Kaplan told CNN’s Anderson Cooper at the time of Trump’s stunt. “I mean, our whole case was about the fact that Donald Trump is unable to follow the law, unable to follow the rules. He thinks they don’t apply to him.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Beginning Monday, Trump will once again sit before a jury in New York, this time with even higher stakes. The jury of 12, along with six alternates, will be chosen from hundreds of New Yorkers after an exhaustive jury selection process that could stretch beyond the first week of the trial.\n",
        "\n",
        "Former US President Donald Trump attends a hearing to determine the date of his trial for allegedly covering up hush money payments linked to extramarital affairs, at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on March 25, 2024. Trump faces twin legal crises today in New York, where he could see the possible seizure of his storied properties over a massive fine as he separately fights to delay a criminal trial even further.

        "RELATED ARTICLE\n",
        "Opinion: Trump seems to be searching Manhattan for one angry juror\n",
        "Choosing a jury will be no easy task when the defendant is a former president who has been at the center of the US political world for nearly 10 years now and a figure in the New York tabloids going back decades.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The problem for both Donald Trump’s attorneys and the prosecution’s attorneys is they’ve got to figure out how to pick a jury for the case who are neutral — and good luck,” said Steve Tuholski, a partner at Delphi Litigation Strategies who works on witness training and jury selection. “I can’t imagine there are many people, especially in New York, that haven’t made up their mind one way or the other about whether he’s a snake or the Messiah. There doesn’t seem to be a middle ground.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The hush-money case is the first of four criminal trials Trump will potentially face — and potentially the only one before the 2024 election, even as Trump has campaigned in part on fusing his legal peril with his bid for the White House.\n",
        "\n",
        "The presumptive Republican 2024 nominee will have plenty of incentive to make an impression on both the jury deciding his guilt or innocence and the broader public, whose opinion of the first criminal trial of a former president in US history could be a determining factor in whether Trump is reelected in November.\n",
        "\n",
        "The vetting process\n",
        "Court officials expect about 100 prospective jurors at a time will be brought into Judge Juan Merchan’s downtown Manhattan courtroom to be vetted when jury selection begins Monday.\n",
        "\n",
        "Merchan released this week the questionnaire that will be presented to potential jurors, which contains multiple questions that could signal political views to the lawyers on both sides.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are questions about news consumption, affiliations with groups like the Proud Boys, QAnon and Antifa, and whether prospective jurors or anyone in their circle attended a Trump rally or an anti-Trump event. Potential jurors will be asked if they’ve ever read books or listened to podcasts from Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and a key witness for the district attorney, or if they’ve read any of Trump’s own books.\n",
        "\n",
        "Those in the jury pool will also be asked if they have views on whether a former president can be charged in state court and how Trump is being treated in this case.\n",
        "\n",
        "The questions will be used for the judge to strike jurors at the outset, if they don’t believe they can render a verdict fairly. They will also be used by lawyers for both sides to strike jurors for any reason — a key part of the jury selection process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a CNN legal analyst and former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney’s office, said that Trump’s attorneys will be looking for jurors who are sympathetic to Trump, of course — but also for anyone who might be an “independent thinker,” willing to stand alone and let a jury hang. A unanimous verdict is required for conviction\n",
        "\n",
        "“If you’re Trump, you’d love an acquittal, but if you can’t get an acquittal, you’d want them to hang, because then there’s no conviction before the election,” Agnifilo said. “You’d want somebody who’s strong enough to be a holdout and somebody who is an independent thinker, who is not going to go along with the group.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The district attorney’s office will be trying to find jurors who are productive, constructive people who have to make decisions regularly and are capable of judging credibility, Agniflio said, criteria that could cover both office managers as well as parents.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Sometimes parents are always good, because parents have to listen to what their kid is saying, and sometimes have to make a credibility determination: ‘Is he telling the truth? Is he not telling the truth?’” she said.\n",
        "\n",
        "One source close to Trump said there is worry that some prospective jurors may have ulterior motives for wanting to be involved in the former president’s trial.\n",
        "\n",
        "Leaving politics aside\n",
        "Trump’s lawyers have already argued that he can’t get a fair jury in New York County, which is Manhattan, because the jury pool there is biased against him. They filed a petition this week, which was denied, to delay the trial so the venue could be moved to a different county.\n",
        "\n",
        "“In terms of pretrial publicity in this county, this case stands alone,” Trump attorney Emil Bove said at Monday’s emergency appeals hearing.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 2020 election, Manhattan voters chose President Joe Biden over Trump 86% to 12%. But just having political views about Trump, for or against, won’t be a reason for potential jurors to be dismissed.\n",
        "\n",
        "“People are going to have an opinion about Trump. That doesn’t mean they can’t be fair and impartial about the evidence and their burden,” Agnifilo said.\n",
        "\n",
        "The political makeup of Manhattan also doesn’t mean Trump won’t have any supporters among the jury pool. During the Carroll defamation trial — which was in a federal court, meaning the jury came from Manhattan as well as parts of nearby counties — two prospective jurors said they believed the 2020 election was stolen, and three said they contributed to Trump’s campaign or a group supporting it.\n",
        "\n",
        "All three of those jurors said that wouldn’t affect their ability to be fair and impartial.\n",
        "\n",
        "Trump took a keen interest in jury selection at the Carroll trial, turning behind him toward the jurors in the gallery behind him to watch as they responded to political questions. When Kaplan asked jurors a series of questions individually, Trump turned in his chair to watch each person speak.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the defamation case, the jury was fully anonymous, meaning no identifying information about the jurors was made public or shared with the attorneys for either side.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the hush-money case, the jury will be known to the attorneys, but Merchan has written that identifying information about jurors will not be publicly released to protect privacy and avoid “exposing them to an atmosphere of intimidation.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Merchan warned Trump in his gag order that the former president can’t make public comments or direct anyone else to make public comments about jurors involved in the proceedings.\n",
        "\n",
        "A ‘dynamic and unpredictable situation’\n",
        "Once a jury is selected, they will be able to watch Trump throughout the duration of the trial, which is expected to last six weeks.\n",
        "\n",
        "That means they can see the former president’s reaction to the district attorney’s allegations, to witness testimony from Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen, and will potentially see him testify and face questions from the district attorney’s office, should Trump choose to testify.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the defamation case in January, Trump’s conduct sitting at the defense table became a point of contention, when he made comments calling the case a “witch hunt” and a “con job” in the presence of the jury while Carroll was on the stand. When the jury was excused at a break, Carroll’s lawyers told the judge what Trump was saying and said they believed it was audible to the jury.\n",
        "\n",
        "That prompted Kaplan to admonish Trump and warn him he could be removed if he continued to be disruptive — prompting the former president to respond that he would “love it” if the judge booted him from the trial.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the jury was present, Kaplan tried to keep a tight rein on Trump as well as all of the attorneys involved. It took longer for the judge to negotiate Trump’s testimony outside the jury’s view — “I want to know everything he is going to say,” Kaplan told Trump’s attorney — than the three minutes Trump spent on the stand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, warned that Merchan could face a “much more dynamic and unpredictable situation” with Trump in front of the jury for the upcoming hush money trial.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Something that gets blurted out in front of a jury is permanent,” he said. “As much as a judge will instruct a jury to disregard that, you can’t un-ring the bell.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, Trump’s conduct can cut both ways for a jury. Tuholski, who works to help prepare witnesses for trial, said that a jury will often sour on witnesses who argue with the judge or don’t answer the questions they’re asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "“In my world, witness demeanor is almost as important and sometimes more important than the actual witness testimony they offer,” he said.\n",

Whether you're ironing your slacks, packing up your checkbook, or boarding the Ferry to Randall's Island with hopes of getting your butt tickled by a sexy octopus, we got you covered. Behold, the 10 most buzzy, striking, dizzying and just plain bizarre happenings on this year's bill.  If you're looking to test your physical strength, eat an ice-cream cone or perhaps make a quick $20, read on to make your artistic dreams a reality.  1. Pia Camil's Free Ponchos\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17 (although we fear the ponchos are already long gone)\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Charlie Porter (@thecharlieporter) on May 13, 2015 at 1:38pm PDT Mexican artist Pia Camil is giving away 800 wearable artworks -- also known as ponchos -- on a first come, first serve basis in the Projects section of Frieze New York.  \\\"Camil's textiles require direct participation, quietly emphasizing the characteristic experience of the art fair, where the act of looking at art is as important as the act of looking at others and distinguishing oneself from them,\\\" the wall label reads. The stunning status symbols, made from fabric remnants and leftovers, are certainly the most stylish works at the fair, not to mention the cheapest. 2. Rebecca Goyette's Dentata Umbrella Lounge\\r\\nWhen: May 14\\u201317\\r\\nWhere: Select Fair, Center 548, Manhattan A post shared by Rebecca Goyette (@rebeccajgoyette) on May 13, 2015 at 4:11pm PDT A post shared by Rebecca Morgan (@rebeccamorgan10) on May 13, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT Performance artist Rebecca Goyette is bringing all the weirdness to Select Art Fair. Her Octopussy-inspired installation \\\"Dentata Umbrella Lounge\\\" includes, among other things, a vibrating Lobsta Labia pillow.   3. Jonathan Horowitz at Gavin Brown's Enterprise\\r\\nWhen: May 14 - 17\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Paul Laster (@plasternyc) on May 14, 2015 at 10:56am PDT A post shared by Paul Laster (@plasternyc) on May 14, 2015 at 10:13am PDT Want to make a quick $20 this art fair weekend? Artist Jonathan Horowitz is inviting fair-goers to participate in his interactive installation at Gavin Brown's booth at Frieze New York. Participants are asked to add acrylic paint onto eight-inch-diameter circles on square-foot canvases, which are then mounted into seven 50-by-50 clusters. Those who succeed walk away with a $20 check -- or an original Jonathan Horowitz, depending on how you look at it. \\\"The whole project, in this iteration, particularity, is about blurring lines,\\\" Horowitz told Vulture. \\\"A lot of work goes into making art beyond the person whose name is signed to the canvas. Art incorporates the installers, the dealers, the people who guard the work, the people who buy the work, the people who write about the work\\u2026 This is about the hand striving for perfection and its inevitable failure to achieve it.\\\" 4. 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair\\r\\nWhen: May 15\\u201317\\r\\nWhere: Pioneer Works, Brooklyn  Billie Zangewa The new Brooklyn fair everyone is talking about, the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair, is hosting 15 galleries either based in Africa or focusing in African contemporary art, located everywhere from Marrakech to Seattle, as well as programming from artists like Hank Willis Thomas. We're particularly excited for Sunday's book launch of \\\"Body Talk: Feminism, Sexuality and the Body in the Work of Six African Women Artists,\\\" featuring curator Koyo Kouoh and participating artist Marcia Kure. See a preview of the fair on Artsy. 5. Blinded by the Light\\r\\nWhen: May 14\\u201317\\r\\nWhere: Select Fair, Center 548, Manhattan The Marina Abromovi\\u0107 Institute presents @Millie_Brown \\\"Blinded by the Light\\\" @SelectFair #SELECT #Art #MillieBrown pic.twitter.com/6TY717bHpl Performance artist Millie Brown, formerly known as our personal favorite vomit artist, is changing direction a bit with her Marina Abramovic Institute (MAI) collar \\\"Blinded by the Light.\\\" At Select Fair, over the course of four days -- or four sun cycles -- Brown will wait in a room of light and looping sound as grains of sand fall onto her head and body until she's eventually buried in a pyramid of the stuff. According to her statement, \\\"she aims to transcend into a state of pure light.\\\" Ambitious indeed. 6. Flux Art Fair\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17\\r\\nWhere: The Corn Exchange Building, Manhattan A post shared by kHyal\\u2122 is MegaGlam\\u2122. (@khyal) on May 13, 2015 at 6:09pm PDT This marks the inaugural edition of Flux, Harlem's first contemporary art fair, a curator-led display revolving around the theme of \\\"21st Century Artist As a Nomad.\\\" The fair also hosts Harlem EatUp!, a wildly delicious looking festival combining all the cultural sights and flavors of Harlem,  organized by Red Rooster's Marcus Samuelsson and Herb Kalitz. \\\"I wanted to marry the best chefs in the country with the best talent in Harlem,\\\" Samuelsson told The New York Post. Our mouths are watering just thinking about it.  7. Spencer Finch's Solar-Powered Ice Cream Truck\\r\\nWhen: May 15-20\\r\\nWhere: Central Park's North End, Manhattan Free ice cream?? #SpencerFinch's \\u201cSunset (Central Park)\\u201d opens @CentralParkNYC this Friday! http://t.co/mh03ira3mG pic.twitter.com/cL3j1XBO37 #Solar powered #icecream! #DriftingInDaylight #Spencerfinch @creativetimeNYC pic.twitter.com/28a8iu8giR As part of Creative Time and Central Park Conservancy's Drifting in Daylight, artist Spencer Finch is bringing an artwork sure to please eco-friendly art lovers and randomly wandering five-year-olds alike. Because ice cream! The artist's rainbow sherbet-colored, solar-powered ice cream truck will dole out soft serve cones that capture all the various hues of spring. 8. Ragnar Kjartansson's \\\"S.S. Hangover\\\"\\r\\nWhen: May 15-20\\r\\nWhere: Central Park's North End, Manhattan Here's #RagnarKjartansson and his musicians (from @metroensemble) taking the S.S. Hangover\\u2026 http://t.co/cuuquInbxS pic.twitter.com/DjS1RdREoS Also a part of Drifting in Daylight, Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson is providing a cure for that champagne-induced headache of yours, in the form of a fishing boat, an ethereal hybrid of Greek, Icelandic and Venetian design. Dubbed \\\"S.S. Hangover,\\\" the part-sculpture, part-sound piece, part-performance, part-vehicle comes complete with a a sextet of brass-playing musicians.  \\u201cI really love music, I have always been in bands, but I think the constraints of the music industry are stifling,\\u201d Kjartansson explained regarding the piece. \\u201cI can do so much more with music by working with sound as a form of sculpture, using sound to take you on a journey.\\\" 9. \\\"Tribute to Flux-Labyrinth 1976/2015\\\"\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by SoftSpot (@softspot.io) on May 14, 2015 at 3:02pm PDT Posted by George Maciunas / Fluxus Foundation Inc. on Monday, April 6, 2015\\r\\n One installation at Frieze New York will pay tribute to the Flux-Labyrinth, an immersive, maze-like environment originally conceived by George Maciunas in collaboration with other Fluxus artists between 1975 and 1976. The highly anticipated happening consists of a 200-foot-long, one-way labyrinth, full of physical and psychological artist-designed challenges sure to make your head spin and body wobble. Some portions are direct replicas of the '70s original, others are contemporary interpretations of the theme. Artists Amalia Pica, John Bock, and Gelatin are responsible for the new segments.  \\\"Upside down forests, balloon pits, and pianos that control portals,\\\" ArtNews reported on the madness. \\\"The maze is full of puzzles and physical challenges. Doorknobs are rarely what they seem... Tip-toeing on tilting catwalks and plunging bare feet into pools of beans, it was hard not to go through the whole delightful thing grinning. At least until the last rooms, designed by John Bock. A tangle of wires and medical tubes hung from the ceiling in the penultimate stretch. A small monitor embedded in the snarl showed a bearded man who seemed to be sleeping. Menacing, but manageable. Pushing past that, Bock served up one final challenge: squeezing through a tunnel lined by large, mostly naked hirsute men, a birth canal of bears.\\\" \\\"Art is meant to stretch you,\\\" Deborah Fisher said of the installation. \\\"And there\\u2019s not a lot else in the fair that\\u2019s doing that.\\\" 10. Samara Golden's Secret Underground Layer\\r\\nWhen: May 14-17, 2015\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan  Samara Golden. Bad Brains, Frieze Fair NY, 2012 Installation shot. Los Angeles artist Samara Golden brings a sinister underbelly to Frieze New York, building a tripped-out infinity chamber beneath the fair tent. Golden's hall of mirrors, which ArtSlant aptly described as \\\"M.C. Escher meets Miami Vice,\\\" features life-sized, hand-sewn, stuffed figures, a couch and chair made from fabrics ranging from bacon strips to flowers to snakes, with a dash of Christian worship stuff and Native American-style bead patterns. There are also skeletons painted in transparent phosphorescent paint, which the viewer can see in the form of a reflection. \\\"Originally I just wanted to show the other side of the fair,\\\" Golden told Phaidon, \\\"or for my piece to be in opposition to the capitalist psychology of the fair. I\\u2019ve been thinking a lot about visualizing layers of consciousness in terms of space.\\\" BONUS: \\u2018Aesthetics\\u2019 of \\u2018Female\\u2019 \\u2018Attractiveness\\u2019\\r\\nWhen: May 15, 12 p.m.\\r\\nWhere: Frieze New York, Randall's Island Park, Manhattan A post shared by Karley Sciortino (@karleyslutever) on May 14, 2015 at 3:14pm PDT As part of Frieze Talks 2015, join your artsy girl crushes Jane Ellison, Grace Dunham, Reina Gossett, Karley Sciortino and Leilah Weinraub as they discuss (rather irreverently) the aesthetics of female attractiveness, with lots of air quotes in there.\",\n          \"Scientists in Scotland may have discovered the most effective way to blast bacteria from health care workers' hands. They say a\\u00a0thorough six-step technique\\u00a0using an alcohol-based hand rub,\\u00a0as recommended by the World Health Organization, is the best method. Watch how it's done: Jacqui Reilly, a professor of infection prevention and control at Glasgow Caledonian University, led a study observing how 42 doctors and 72 nurses used the rub and cleaned their hands after treating patients. For the research, which was\\u00a0published\\u00a0this month in\\u00a0Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, scientists recorded how long it took the health care\\u00a0workers to wash their hands, as well as their pre- and post-washing median bacterial counts.\\u00a0 The health care workers who performed the six-step technique took an average of 42.5 seconds and reduced their median bacterial count from 3.28 to 2.58. Those who used a three-step technique --\\u00a0applying the alcohol-based product to one hand, rubbing their hands together until they were fully covered, then rubbing until they were dry\\u00a0--\\u00a0spent 7.5 seconds less on the process. Their median bacterial count lowered from 3.08 to an average of 2.88. Reilly said that there had previously been \\\"limited evidence on which technique is most effective\\\" and that this study provided \\\"a foundation for effective best practices to implement on the front lines of healthcare.\\\"\",\n          \"The younger sister of Dylann Roof, the convicted mass murderer who\\u00a0killed nine people\\u00a0at a historic black church in South Carolina, was arrested Wednesday for allegedly bringing weapons to her school on the same day the National Student Walkout was planned. Morgan Roof, an 18-year-old student of A.C. Flora High School in Columbia, South Carolina, was charged with possession of marijuana and two counts of carrying weapons on school grounds, according to The State newspaper. An administrator at the school alerted a school resource officer that a student on campus had made a threatening and racist Snapchat post and brought pepper spray and a knife to school. The Richland County Sheriff\\u2019s Department later confirmed that the student was Morgan Roof. Roof\\u2019s Snapchat post criticized her schoolmates at Flora High for participating in the nationwide student walkouts in protest of gun violence on Wednesday. The protests were being held on the one-month anniversary of a horrific mass shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \\u201cI hope it\\u2019s a trap and y\\u2019all get shot,\\u201d Roof wrote of the protest at her school, according to a screenshot of her Snapchat post. \\u201cWe know it\\u2019s fixing to be nothing but black people walkin out anyway. This is Morgan Roof, Dylann Roofs little sister, her snapchats there and all do your thang twitter pic.twitter.com/MttSF875is Roof\\u2019s racist post was especially disturbing considering the heinous crimes of her brother, who is an avowed white supremacist. In June 2015, Dylann Roof walked into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston and opened fire on a Bible study group. He killed nine people. The 22-year-old shooter was found guilty on 33 federal charges and sentenced to death. One of Dylann Roof\\u2019s friends told investigators that he hoped the massacre would start a race war. In a letter to students, parents and faculty,\\u00a0Principal Susan Childs said that a student\\u2019s social media post caused \\u201cquite a disruption\\u201d on campus. Childs\\u2019 letter did not identify Morgan Roof but described her post as a \\u201chateful message\\u201d that was \\u201cextremely inappropriate.\\u201d Chris Slick, a neighbor of the Roofs, told The Post and Courier that Morgan Roof wasn\\u2019t hateful. \\u201cTragedy has struck this family again,\\u201d Slick told the newspaper.\\u00a0 \\u201cThis is not the Morgan I knew. She didn\\u2019t hate people. She didn\\u2019t have prejudices like this \\u2014 in fact, I witnessed the opposite,\\u201d\\u00a0he added. \\u201cI hope that one day, one day she finds peace and seeks forgiveness for what she did today. I cannot say I wish the same for her brother.\\u201d In a series of tweets, Gov. Henry McMaster said that \\u201cpotential tragedy was avoided\\u201d at Flora High on Wednesday. He also called on the state General Assembly to pass legislation requiring police officers to be present\\u00a0at every school.\\u00a0\\u00a0 Law enforcement officials took Morgan Roof to the Richland County Detention Center, according to CBS affiliate WLTX 19. She was released on a $5,000 bond with the condition that she not return to school.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

It warned that \\u201ca court would have little difficulty finding that strict application\\u201d of the state\\u2019s deadline would \\u201cimpose a severe restriction\\u201d on ballot access.

He was emaciated and had duct tape and burns on his wrists and legs, authorities said. Franke's 10-year-old malnourished daughter was also found by officers in Hildebrandt's house. She was taken to the hospital.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHildebrandt and Franke were arrested after authorities found evidence the children were tortured in the home. \\r\\n\\r\\nYouTube Mom Child Abuse \\r\\nThis image taken from body camera footage provided by Washington County Attorney's Office shows Jodi Hildebrandt, left, and Ruby Franke, center, being arrested on child abuse charges on Aug. 30, 2023, in Ivins, Utah. \\r\\n/ AP\\r\\nThe arresting officer said Hildebrandt had \\\"knowledge of the abuse, malnourishment, and neglect in the home.\\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nFranke's popular \\\"8 Passengers\\\" YouTube channel dispensed advice, often from the basement of Hildebrandt's home. She also appeared in a video posted online by Hildebrandt's counseling business, ConneXions Classroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nNestled behind striking sandstone foothills, the Utah property, which has a \\\"concrete storage room under the garage\\\" has floor-to-ceiling glass windows and expansive views of the craggy desert landscape from almost every room. There are built-in closets and a granite countertop kitchen overlooking the backyard and in-ground pool. In addition to the four bedrooms, the house, which was built in 2017, has a five-car garage, and three-and-a-half baths. \\r\\n\\r\\nHildebrandt's house has dropped in price by $305,000, according to Realtor.com, and is now listed for $4,995,000. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe listing beat views on nine other properties, including the country's most expensive listing \\u2014 Gordon's Pointe in Naples, Florida.
